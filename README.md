👋 Hey there! I’m Fernando, a telecommunications engineer based on the stunning coast of Rías Baixas, Galicia. By day, I work as a Network Administrator, diving into network management and IT infrastructure. By night, I’m all about home automation, IoT, and a strong advocate for self-hosting—there’s nothing like running your own services! Recently, I’ve been exploring Meshtastic, pushing the boundaries of off-grid communication tech.

🌍 When I’m not managing networks or tinkering with Linux systems, you’ll find me hiking, capturing landscapes through my lens, or connecting with people via amateur radio (EA1FTE). I keep the joy of offline communication alive by sending postcards worldwide through Postcrossing. Curious to learn more? Head over to my website https://fernandodpr.es and say hello!
